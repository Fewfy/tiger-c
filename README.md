Purpose
=======

This project is my practice of the book "Modern Compiler Implementation in C".

Progress
========

Chapter 1 - Program 2:

Write a function `void interp(ast_stmt_t)` that "interprets" a program in
this language. To write in a "functional programming" style -- in while you
never use an assignment statement -- initialize each local variable as you
declare it.
