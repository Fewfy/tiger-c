Purpose
=======

This project is my practice of the book "Modern Compiler Implementation in C".

Progress
========

Chapter 1 - Program 1:

Write a function int `maxargs(ast_stmt_t)` that tells the maximum number of
arguments of any print statement within any subexpression of a given statement.
For example, `maxargs(prog)` is 2.
